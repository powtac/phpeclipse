    too helpful - we can do that from the command line, or via the web
    browser. The real power in debugging comes from the ability to set
    breakpoints and step through scripts. A breakpoint is just that - a point
    in your script at which you would like to break. What will happen is that
    the PHP Interpreter will continue as normal until it reaches the specified
    line in your program. When it reaches that line, it will stop and wait for
    your instructions as to how to proceed.</p><p>To set a breakpoint, move the mouse over the gray bar at the far
    left of the margin. Right click beside the line at which you want to
    break, and select the option 'Toggle Breakpoint'. Ensure you select
    'Toggle Breakpoint' and not 'Toggle PHP Breakpoint' - the latter will not
    work. After you toggle the breakpoint, a blue ball should appear in the
    gray margin beside the line you specified.</p><div class="figure"><a name="phpeclipse.debugginglocal.debugbreakpoint"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 3. Debug Breakpoint</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="debugbreakpoint.png" alt="Debug Breakpoint"></div></div></div></div><p><br class="figure-break">After you have added your breakpoint, select Debug
    History-myFirstProject (or whatever name you gave your configuration) from
    the Run menu.</p><p>Now, to view our debug information, we need to change to our Debug
    Perspective. To do this, select the Window drop down menu and select Open
    Perspective-Debug.</p><p>There are a number of things you will notice on the Debug
    perspective. The top left has a list of scripts that are currently
    running. There are button in this pane that can control the execution of
    the script. The first button labelled in the diagram is the Resume button.
    Clicking on this button will cause execution of your script to resume
    until it reaches the next breakpoint. The second button that is labelled
    is the Terminate button. This button will cause execution of your script
    to terminate. The third button and fourth buttons are the Step Into and
    Step Over buttons. These will both cause one line of your script to run.
    The difference between the two is that the Step Into button will expand
    any function calls on the line, and the step over button will treat
    function calls as one line. So, if you are not worried about the functions
    that are being called on a given line, you should use Step Over. If you
    want to see exactly what the functions are doing, you should use Step
    Into.</p><p>To the right of the Debug pane you will see a pane with a Variables
    tab and a Breakpoints tab. In the variables tab, you will see a list of
    variables that are in the current scope. Our script uses two variables -
    $i and $output. You will notice that a number of environment variables are
    also listed. Along with the list of variables, you can see the values of
    those variables. This is useful if you want to track what happens to a
    variable over the course of execution of your script. Clicking on the
    Breakpoints tab will allow you to see a list of breakpoints that have been
    set for your script. From this tab, you can turn breakpoints on and off by
    checking or unchecking the checkboxes that are beside them. There are also
    buttons to remove selected breakpoints and to remove all breakpoints for
    your script.</p><p>Underneath, you will see an editor containing the current source
    file that is being executed. A blue arrow generally follows execution of
    your script. At the very bottom is a window that displays the Console
    where you can see the output of your script.</p><div class="figure"><a name="phpeclipse.debugginglocal.debugperspective"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 4. The Debug Perspective</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="debugperspective.png" alt="The Debug Perspective"></div></div></div></div><p><br class="figure-break"></p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar03s03.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ar03.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar03s05.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Setting up the Debugger </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Watching our Script Run</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
